# CS250-Agile

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   User stories allow a person to think like a user. It's an excersize in perception, trying to see things from the eyes of your intended audience. 
   
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    Learning about agile has been a great deal of fun. The learning and experiment/learn model will help guide my development when I encounter a problem that I'm unsure how to solve.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   Good communication and taking responsibility for your work. It's especially important to treat people in a kind and friendly way. This isn't just important for software developement, it's important for being a good person.
